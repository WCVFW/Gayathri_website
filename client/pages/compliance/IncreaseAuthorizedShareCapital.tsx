          Increase Authorised Share Capital: Procedure and Documents
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
          While incorporating a company, the promoters need to decide upon the authorised share capital of the company. Generally, the authorised share capital is decided based on the requirements of the company at the time of incorporation. However, as the company grows, the fund requirements of the company grow thus necessitating the issue of more shares. But how can more shares be issued by a company if it has already issued all the shares? Let's see!
        </p>
      </section>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-navy mb-3">What is Authorized Capital?</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        As per <strong>Section 2(8) of the Companies Act, 2013</strong>, authorized capital (also called nominal capital) is the maximum share capital that a company is legally permitted to issue, as defined in its <strong>Memorandum of Association (MOA)</strong>.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Simply put, it represents the cap on the total value of shares a company can issue to shareholders. To issue shares beyond this limit, the company must follow a formal procedure to increase the authorized capital by altering the capital clause in its MOA.

          How to Increase the Authorized Share Capital â€“ Step-by-Step Process

          <li>
            <strong>Check the Articles of Association:</strong> The Articles of Association must contain a clause to authorize the company to increase its authorised share capital. If such a clause is absent, then articles shall be amended by passing a special resolution in the general meeting to insert this clause. It is only after the authorization of the articles that the company can increase its authorised share capital.

            <strong>Holding a Board Meeting:</strong> A board meeting shall be held to call an Extraordinary General Meeting. Notice shall be sent to all the directors of the company to their registered addresses at least 7 days before the meeting. In the board meeting, the board must resolve to call an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) to present the resolution for the alteration of the authorised share capital.

            <strong>Holding the Extraordinary General Meeting:</strong> A notice for the extraordinary general meeting shall be sent to the shareholders of the company including the date, time, place, and agenda of the meeting.

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-navy">1. Do I need to check the Articles of Association before increasing authorised share capital?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes, the Articles of Association (AOA) must include a provision allowing the company to increase its authorised share capital.
              If this clause is missing, the AOA needs to be amended first by passing a <em>special resolution</em> at a general meeting.

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-navy">2. What is the role of the Board Meeting in this process?</h3>
            <p>
              A Board Meeting must be held to propose the increase in authorised share capital and to approve the convening of an
              <em> Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM)</em>. All directors must receive a notice of this meeting at least 7 days in advance.

              A formal notice of the EGM must be sent to shareholders, stating the date, time, location, agenda, and method of voting.
              This notice should be issued at least 21 days before the meeting (unless a shorter notice is agreed upon). During the EGM,
              an <em>ordinary resolution</em> must be passed to approve the increase in authorised share capital.
